# `<fs-scrollable />`

This Web Component lets you transform HTML container into horizontally scrollable elements. Thatâ€™s especially convenient for touch menus. By default it shows clickable arrow buttons, which can be used as an alternative to swiping. See below for customization options.

## Usage
- Run `$ npm run build` to create a build.
- Include that JavaScript file in your frontend.
- Use this Web Component by wrapping your desired HTML code like this:
	```html
	<fs-scrollable>
		<div class="make-me-scrollable">My very long horizontal element, which should be scrollable.</div>
	</fs-scrollable>
	```
- Make sure, that the `.make-me-scrollable` element extends to its full width and causes no line wraps.

## Customization
- `<fs-scrollable />` will show clickable buttons and gradients by default.
- `<fs-scrollable hide-buttons />` will only show gradients.
- `<fs-scrollable hide-gradients />` will not show gradients nor buttons.
- In your theme you can use these CSS custom properties for further adjustments:
	- `--fs-scrollable--background-color` defaults to `white`
	- `--fs-scrollable--color-text` defaults to `black`
	- `--fs-scrollable--gradient-width` defaults to `20px`
	- `--fs-scrollable--transition-speed` defaults to `0.1s`
  - `--fs-scrollable--image-size` defaults to `24px`
